# Neurobehavioral Systems' Presentation

[Presentation](https://www.neurobs.com/index_html) is an unfortunately named
software package for creating human behavioral and neuroscientific
experiments

This Visual Studio Code extension provides basic syntax highlighting and
standard editing features (bracket closing, commenting, etc...) for the
scripts used to create experiments in Presentation. These have the extension
'sce', 'pcl', or 'sdl'.

## Status

This *should* work for your day to day coding purposes. Highlighting seems to
work well, but has only been moderately tested. The extension is relatively
dumb: nothing fancy is done to handle different contexts (e.g. the SDL header
and PCL program body).
