# Neurobehavioral Systems' Presentation

[Presentation](https://www.neurobs.com/index_html) is an unfortunately named
software package for creating human behavioral and neuroscientific
experiments

This Visual Studio Code extension provides basic syntax highlighting and
standard editing features (bracket closing, commenting, etc...) for the
scripts used to create experiments in Presentation. These have the extension
'sce', 'pcl', or 'sdl'.

## Status

This is early days; highlighting seems to work well, but it is not thoroughly
tested yet. The extension is relatively dumb: very little validation of the
syntax occurs. Some forms that are syntactically invalid (because they are in
the wrong code context) are highlighted to look valid.
