# Change Log

All notable changes to the "neurobehave-presentation" extension will be
documented in this file.

## [0.0.4]
Updated vulnerable dependency. At this point the extension has been
moderately tested. Updating README to reflect this.

## [0.0.3]
Added missing bool keyword.

## [0.0.2]

Syntax appears to be correctly applied to all Presentation file types, and
I will now start using the extension myself to test it out more.

## [0.0.1]

Sort-of working....
